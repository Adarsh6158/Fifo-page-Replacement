# FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm with OpenGL Visualization
This repository contains an implementation of the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) page replacement algorithm using C++ and OpenGL. The project aims to provide a visually appealing demonstration of how the FIFO algorithm works in managing memory pages.

# Introduction
Page replacement algorithms play a vital role in operating systems, particularly in managing the limited memory resources available to processes. The FIFO algorithm is one of the simplest and most intuitive methods used for this purpose.

**Features:**
- Interactive visualization: ...
- User-friendly interface: ...
- Adjustable parameters: ...

**Installation:**
1. Clone this repository to your desired location using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/fifo-page-replacement.git`
2. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   - C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
   - OpenGL library (e.g., freeglut, GLFW)
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. For example, with g++:
4. Run the compiled executable: `./fifo-page-replacement`

**Usage:**
Once the program is running, you can interact with the visualization using the following controls:
- Left-click: Insert a page request into the sequence.
- Right-click: Remove the most recently added page request.
- Spacebar: Start/stop the page replacement process.
- Escape: Quit the program.

# Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the concept of page replacement algorithms and their significance in operating systems. The visualization was developed using the OpenGL library, which provides powerful tools for creating interactive graphics applications.

# Contributions
Contributions to this project are always welcome. If you encounter any issues or have ideas to enhance the visualization or the underlying algorithm, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
